## 🛠️ **SQL Analysis Performed**  

### **1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
- Handled **missing values** and standardized date formats.  
- Filtered out irrelevant data for meaningful analysis.  

### **2️⃣ Global COVID-19 Cases & Deaths Analysis**  
- Aggregated data to find **total cases, deaths, and recovery rates** per country.  
- Identified **countries with the highest and lowest fatality rates**.  

### **3️⃣ Infection Trends Over Time**  
- Used **window functions to track daily, weekly, and monthly case trends**.  
- Analyzed **spikes in cases and their correlation with government interventions**.  

### **4️⃣ Vaccination Impact Analysis**  
- Assessed how **vaccination rates affected case and mortality rates**.  
- Compared **regions with high vs. low vaccination coverage**.  

### **5️⃣ Mortality & Recovery Rate Insights**  
- Calculated **mortality and survival rates per region**.  
- Evaluated **hospitalization trends and healthcare system impact**.
